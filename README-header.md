## Comparison between every 2 grids

In the [differences](https://github.com/AmitMY/grids/tree/master/differences) folder, you can find a comparison between each 2 grids we have data on.

It is recommended to check it out before getting a "pro" version of a grid, to see what you are actually paying for.

## Shallow Comparison
Here we compare the grids using the markdown table, to show no bias to any grid. If willing, other grids can show this table using their grid.
This comparison is alphabetical, to avoid owner's bias.

*Note:* Because the similarities don't matter, this table only shows the differences:
